         <p>This laptop is overall $750 dollars. It has very good specs for the price.<br/> The i7 can handle 1080p rendering, but the ssd
		s slow write speed might slow it down.</p>
		<p> Build quality is very good. Full aluminum. <br/>Screen is a 1080p ips panel with infinity edge display. The webcam is 720p and is 
		decent.<br/> Keyboard is great. One of the best for this price. The trackpad is not so great. Elan drivers and imperfect tracking.
		</p>
		<p>It has an intel hd 520 OR iris 540 that can handel low to medium demanding games.<br/> 8gb of ddr3 ram, it's the sweet spot for
		normal use.
		</p>
		<p> The heat is fine. Nothing too bad, the speakers are good. <br/>Loud, nice bass, on the bottom, but it isn't particulary clear.</p>
	    <p>Unfortunately, I wish they gave us better ports.<br/> In this model, they give us mini hdmi, and 2 usb 2.0 and an ssd along
		with the microphone and headphone jack.</p>
